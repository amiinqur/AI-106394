## Short Description ## 
Firstly, we downloaded all the required files from Kaggle. Then we split the collected data for cross-validation. We gathered the algorithms that we wanted to apply from Scikit and applied the algorithm on our data file. We kept cross validating and applying the data on different algorithms until we got the desired accuracy and results. Afterwards, we ran our program on test.csv that we downloaded from Kaggle and submitted the results on Kaggle. 

## Insights Gained ##  

**Insight 1: Various accuracy rates**  
The first insight that we gained was that, upon running our test data on different algorithms and models we got varying accuracy rates. This surprised us, becuase we thought that changing the algorithms will not affect the result that much.  

**Insight 2: Deep impact of cross-validation**  
We did not think that cross-validation is important to get the disred results with high accuracy, so we proceeded with the algorithms without cross-validating the data. The results that we got were undesirable and the accuracy rates were also not very appealing. Thus, we cross-validated the data and ther was a noticable improvement in the results and we got an important insight that cross-validation is really important.  

**Insight 3: Competition**  
Honestly, before this assignment we had no idea what Kaggle was. This assignment opened a whole new world to us of online Programming competitions. We got really excited to see that there are so many competitions on the website that we never heard of before.
